- if you want to run tests just type = npm test
Backend configuration file:
- is not included in the code so create one with name = .env (linux ... nano .env)

    #connection string use to connect to your mongo db atlas you can generate it in mongo db atlas web application

If you want to run backend in cloud do these other steps on your virtual machine.
!!all these commands are executed on debian ec2 instance on aws!!

Download ufw firewall end enable 80, 443 ports
- sudo apt install ufw
- sudo ufw enable
- sudo ufw allow ssh
- sudo ufw allow 80
- sudo ufw allow 443

Create instance for realmarketplace backedn deamon:
- sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/realmarketplace.service
Add this configuration into realmarketplace.service:
[Unit]
Description=RealMarketPlace backend deamon
After=network.target
StartLimitIntervalSec=0
[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=2
#WorkingDirectory absolute path to realmarketplace_backend/src cloned folder from github
WorkingDirectory=/home/admin/realmarketplace_backend/src/
#ExecStart absolute path to npm and execute start function to start listing
ExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start
KillMode=process
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target

After saving the configuration of the backend execute this commands to complete configuration of deamon service:
- sudo systemctl daemon-reload
- sudo systemctl enable realmarketplace
- sudo systemctl start realmarketplace
- sudo systemctl status realmarketplace

Install nginx:
- sudo apt install nginx
In nginx configuration file edit this information's:
server 80{
    ...
        #server domain name
      server_name realmarketplace.shop www.realmarketplace.shop;

        location / {
                #in default configuration will server run on port 3000
                proxy_pass http://localhost:3000; #whatever port your app runs on
                proxy_http_version 1.1;
                proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
                proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
                proxy_set_header Host $host;
                proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
        }
    ...
}

To generate ssl certificate I will be use certbot that use Letâ€™s Encrypt to generate it.
- sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
- sudo apt-get update
- sudo apt-get install python3-certbot-nginx
- sudo certbot --nginx -d realmarketplace.shop -d www.realmarketplace.shop
# Only valid for 90 days, test the renewal process with
- certbot renew --dry-run
